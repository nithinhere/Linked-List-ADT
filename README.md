# Linked-List-ADT
we are going to implement the ADT using a linked list. This queue is an expandable
queue, and it is to be implemented using an underlying linked list to store all queue values. The
public interface of the queue class should be specified in queuelist.h and the class
implementation should be in queuelist.cpp. Note that since the queue uses dynamic memory, the
“Big-4” methods must also be implemented.
1. a default constructor that creates an empty queue.
2. a copy constructor to ensure deep copy of objects;
3. a destructor to avoid memory leak;
4. an overloaded assignment operator for deep copy and avoiding memory leaks.
You will need to add the appropriate declarations of the above methods in the header file.
